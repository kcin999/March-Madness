# March-Madness
This is a project with March Madness and NCAA data. Had the idea to go find data in class one day, and started creating various metrics.

The end goal is to be able to use data to help predict and make choosing brackets easier down the road. I will start incorporating past data soon. This is a hobby project of mine, so it will be done over time, but classes come first.

This has gone through a few iterations / change of plans. I will be the first to admit that I have changed my mind / lost focus on it. So in the [archive folder](/Archive/), there are my old attempts / tasks on this project, as well as detailed information within their respective READMEmds. If I get time, I would like to combine my results, but for now, these are more isolated.

## Installation
There are a couple of softwares / programs that needs to be installed. 
* Python
* Microsoft PowerBI

### Development Notes
I was originally was using the sportspi / sports reference package found [here](https://sportsreference.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but upon coming back to this project, it was no longer working, so I am working on writing my own.

My main focus / interest right now is tying in Machine Learning in an attempt to mirror my class work, so that is what I am working on, in order to create a better bracket.


### Python
Python needs to be installed. Can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Things I am wanting to accomplish
1. See what overall makes a winning team, a winning team. Compare stats across years, using a system of rankings
2. Tie in Machine Learning
