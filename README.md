# March-Madness
This is a project with March Madness and NCAA data. Had the idea to go find data in class one day, and started creating various metrics.

The end goal is to be able to use data to help predict and make choosing brackets easier down the road. I will start encorporating past data soon. This is a hobby project of mine.
